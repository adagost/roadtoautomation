# Git Cheat sheet

#### Additional cheat sheets included in the 'Cheat sheet' folder.

## Check your Git config
The command below returns a list of information about your git configuration including user name and email:
  
`git config -l`

## Setup your username
With the command below you can configure your user name:  
`git config --global user.name "Amelia"`
 
## Setup your user email
This command lets you setup the user email address you'll use in your commits.  
`git config --global user.email "test@email.com`
## Cache your login credentials
You can store login credentials in the cache so you don't have to type them in each time. Just use this command:  
`git config --global credential.helper cache`

## Initialize a repo
Everything starts from here. The first step is to initialize a new Git repo locally in your project root. You can do so with the command below:  
`git init`
## Add a file to staging 
The command below will add a file to the staging area. Just replace filename_here with the name of the file you want to add to the staging area.  
`git add filename_here`
## Add all files to staging
If you want to add all files in your project to the staging area, you can use a wildcard `.` and every file will be added for you.  
`git add .`
## Add only certain files to staging
With the asterisk in the command below, you can add all files starting with 'fil' in the staging area.  
`git add fil*`
## Check a repository's status
This command will show the status of the current repository including staged, unstaged, and untracked files.  
`git status`
## Commit changes
This command will open a text editor in the terminal where you can write a full commit message.

A commit message is made up of a short summary of changes, an empty line, and a full description of the changes after it.  
`git commit`
## Commit changes with a message
You can add a commit message without opening the editor. This command lets you only specify a short summary for your commit message.  
`git commit -m 'your message'`
## See your commit history
This command shows the commit history for the current repository:  
`git log`
## See your commit history including changes
This command shows the commit's history including all files and their changes:  
`git log -p`
## See a specific commit
This command shows a specific commit.

Replace commit-id with the id of the commit that you find in the commit log after the word commit  
`git show commit-id`
## See log stats
This command will cause the Git log to show some statistics about the changes in each commit, including line(s) changed and file names.  
`git log --stat`

## How to see changes made before committing them using "diff"
You can pass a file as a parameter to only see changes on a specific file.
`git diff` shows only unstaged changes by default.

We can call diff with the `--staged` flag to see any staged changes.  
`git diff`  
`git diff all_checks.py`  
`git diff --staged`

## How to see changes using "git add -p"
This command opens a prompt and asks if you want to stage changes or not, and includes other options. 
`git add -p`

## Remove tracked files from the current working tree 

This command expects a commit message to explain why the file was deleted.  
`git rm filename`

## Renaming files

This command stages the changes, then it expects a commit message.  
`git mv oldfile newfile`

## How to ignore files 

Create a `.gitignore`file and commit it

## How to revert staged changes
You can use the -p option flag to specify the changes you want to reset.

`git reset HEAD filename` 

`git reset HEAD -p `

## How to amend the most recent commit
`git commit -amend` allows you to modify and add changes to the most recent commit

!!Note!!: fixing up a local commit with amend is great and you can push it to a shared repository after you've fixed it. But you should avoid amending commits that have already been made public.

## Rolling back the last commit

`git revert`will create a new commit that is the opposite of everything in the given commit.
We can revert the latest commit by using the head alias like this:  
`git revert HEAD`

## Rolling back an old commit
You can revert an old commit using its commit id. This opens the editor so you can add a commit message.  
`git revert commit_id_here`

## Creating a Branch

By default, you have one branch, the main branch. With this command, you can create a new branch. Git won't switch to it automatically â€“ you will need to do it manually with the next command.  
`git branch branch_name`

## Switching to a branch

When you want to use a different or a newly created branch you can use this command:  
`git checkout branch_name`

## Listing branches
You can view all created branches using the `git branch command`. It will show a list of all branches and mark the current branch with an asterisk and highlight it in green.

## Create a branch and switch to it immediately
In a single command, you can create and switch to a new branch right away.  
`git checkout -b branch name`

## How to delete a branch
When you are done working with a branch and have merged it, you can delete it using the command below:  
`git branch -d branch_name`

## How to merge two branches
To merge the history of the branch you are currently in with the `branch_name`, you will need to use the command below:  
`git merge branch_name`
## How to abort a conflicting merge
`git merge --abort`

## How to add a remote repository
This command adds a remote repository to your local repository (just replace https://repo_here with your remote repo URL).  
`git add remote https://repo_here`

## How to see remote URLs
You can see all remote repositories for your local repository with this command:  
`git remote -v`

## How to push changes to a remote repo
When all your work is ready to be saved on a remote repository, you can push all changes using the command below:  
`git push`
## How to pull changes from a remote repo
If other team members are working on your repository, you can retrieve the latest changes made to the remote repository with the command below:  
`git pull`

## How to check remote branches that Git is tracking
This command shows the name of all remote branches that Git is tracking for the current repository:  
`git branch -r`

## How to fetch remote repo changes
This command will download the changes from a remote repo but will not perform a merge on your local branch (as git pull does that instead).  

`git fetch`

## How to check the current commits log of a remote repo
Commit after commit, Git builds up a log. You can find out the remote repository log by using this command:  
`git log origin/main`
## Merge a remote repo with your local repo
If the remote repository has changes you want to merge with your local, then this command will do that for you:  
`git merge origin/main`
## Get the contents of remote branches in Git without automatically merging
This lets you update the remote without merging any content into the
local branches. You can call git merge or git checkout to do the merge.  
`git remote update`
## Push a new branch to a remote repo
If you want to push a branch to a remote repository you can use the command below. Just remember to add -u to create the branch upstream:  
`git push -u origin branch_name`
## Remove a remote branch
If you no longer need a remote branch you can remove it using the command below:  
`git push --delete origin branch_name_here`
## How to use Git rebase
You can transfer completed work from one branch to another using git rebase.  
`git rebase branch_name_here`
